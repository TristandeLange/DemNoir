You wrested your bread from the clutch of an urchin child. He snivels on the cobbled steps of the street the two of you tussled in, turning up the eyes of a teary-eyed dog at you. Frustration and sorrow play on his features, "Damnit!" He wails, "I'm never strong enough to get nuffin', I'm gonna starve on these streets!"

Null

You make the bread vanish from your hands with the skill of an above average street magician. The wonder in the boy's eyes is blatant, as much as it quickly fades into anger and frustration, "Hey!"

The logic of what you said plays over the boy's face for a long while, him weighing his options and possible gain to holding you at knifepoint for food now, or hearing you out for more food later. He makes the wiser choice, and you recount to him what you know:
Dealing With the Urchin
Null
> Give him accurate details and offer to set up a racket where he'd collect food on a system of stops you'd design, the food split between you
> He's bound to come back once he's had his fill. or worse, you might have to find other sources of food once he knows your current ones. So, you feed him false information that'll put him both far from you and likely in the prejudiced eye of the Gypsy Court.
