You wrested your bread from the clutch of an urchin child. He snivels on the cobbled steps of the street the two of you tussled in, turning up the eyes of a teary-eyed dog at you. Frustration and sorrow play on his features, "Damnit!" He wails, "I'm never strong enough to get nuffin', I'm gonna starve on these streets!"
Dealing With the Urchin
> Offer him a piece of your bread, and a few lessons on how to better wrestle down some larger kids on the street for what they might have to spare
> Give him a valuable lesson, in the form of a smack to the back of his head and the instruction to get a job

You make the bread vanish from your hands with the skill of an above average street magician. The wonder in the boy's eyes is blatant, as much as it quickly fades into anger and frustration, "Hey!" He pulls a shiv from under his torn up jacket, "Give up that bread, slow-like, or I'll cut you something fierce. Nothing personal."
Dealing With the Urchin
> Offer to show him how you did the trick, along with a few tricks to better go unnoticed when robbing folks
> You know your way around a knife fight, disarm and leave him sputtering in the mud of this street

The boy's features contort in confusion. In expectation of some sort of catch, he pauses at your held out offering of half your bread.  He takes it with careful eyes watching you. After a set of mouthfuls, he nods demurely, "I'm not so good with'n my words, but I owe you one."
Dealing With the Urchin
> Offer to have him for some tea or coffee once you've landed your feet.
> Tell him to be off and joke that you might be collecting on that debt at a later date

The logic of what you said plays over the boy's face for a long while, him weighing his options and possible gain to holding you at knifepoint for food now, or hearing you out for more food later. He makes the wiser choice, and you recount to him what you know:
Dealing With the Urchin
> Give him accurate details and offer to set up a racket where he'd collect food on a system of stops you'd design, the food split between you
> He's bound to come back once he's had his fill. or worse, you might have to find other sources of food once he knows your current ones. So, you feed him false information that'll put him both far from you and likely in the prejudiced eye of the Gypsy Court.
